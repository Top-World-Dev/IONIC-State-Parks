In the 1930s during the depression, the site was chosen as a location for one of the Tennessee Valley Authority's dams on the Tennessee River. What comprises the park today was once the living area for the TVA construction crews and their families. The TVA Village, better known as Pickwick Village was located where the Post Office, Park office and day use area are now located.",

All hiking trails on the park will be closed. The backcountry shelters at the park will also be closed, as well as the primitive group camp. </p><p>At Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park, the work is expected to last from June through August. All trails north of Pilot Knob will be closed as well as the group campground. </p><p>The timber sale at each park will be overseen by the park manager and a consulting forester to ensure best practices are observed throughout the process. A detailed bid and selection process will be used, and the contractor will clear the trails system and affected surroundings of hazardous trees for the safety of park guests and the re-establishment of a healthy forest. Each park will implement a plan for growth of hardwood forest with early successional habitat established in the next few years.</p>"

All hiking trails on the park will be closed. The backcountry shelters at the park will also be closed, as well as the primitive group camp. </p><p>At Nathan Bedford Forrest State Park, the work is expected to last from June through August. All trails north of Pilot Knob will be closed as well as the group campground. </p><p>The timber sale at each park will be overseen by the park manager and a consulting forester to ensure best practices are observed throughout the process. A detailed bid and selection process will be used, and the contractor will clear the trails system and affected surroundings of hazardous trees for the safety of park guests and the re-establishment of a healthy forest. Each park will implement a plan for growth of hardwood forest with early successional habitat established in the next few years.</p>"

He joined the pacifist Church of Christ in Christian Union in 1914, and when drafted for service in World War I in 1917, he applied for conscientious objector status, but was denied. On Oct. 8, 1918, while on patrol along the Meuse-Argonne Front in France, York and his platoon wandered behind enemy lines and were caught in an ambush that left over half the platoon dead.",
